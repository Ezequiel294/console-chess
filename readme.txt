To run the console chess game, follow these steps:
Requirements:
	- C Compiler: You need a C compiler, such as gcc, installed on your system.
	- Nerd Font: The terminal must support chess piece icons. Install a Nerd Font (e.g., JetBrains Mono Nerd Font) and set it as the terminal's font.

Steps to Compile and Run

    - Open a terminal with the Nerd Font set as the default font.
    - Navigate to the directory containing main.c.
    - If using gcc, compile the program using the following gcc command:
	gcc -o chess_game main.c

Run the compiled program with:
    ./chess_game

Notes:
    - Ensure the terminal supports Unicode and the Nerd Font is correctly set to display the chess piece icons.
    - Follow the in-game instructions to play. Use chess notation for moves (e.g., e2).
